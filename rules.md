#QuantumCards : A quant-fun game for 4 players.
QuantumCards is a game that uses lets players use their knowledge of quantum mechanics(!) to maximize thier chance of winning while minimizing their opoenets.

##Basic rules of the game:
There are four players, each holding a number qbits.
On each players turn, they draw a gate from the gate-deck, and play it on any qbit(s) on the table, manipulating the wavefunction of the game.
At the end of the game, when the gate-deck has been emptyed, the qbits are measured, and the wavefunction collapes.
Whoever's hand has evaulated to the highest sum of bits, wins.
Therfore, the objective is to use the gates on other players to maximize the probabilty of your hand evaulating to the highest number of 1s.

Use the intuition that you've built about the cards and quantum mechanics to challange your friends and improve your understanding of QM!
