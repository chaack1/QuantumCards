QuantumCards is a game that uses lets players use their knowledge of quantum mechanics(!) to maximize thier chance of winning the game.

##Basic rules of the game:
There are a number of players each given a number of qbits, and a set of quantum gates to manipulate said qubits. Players take turns playing the gates in their hands on any qbit(s) on the table, be it one of their own or one of their opponents'. At the end of the game, the state of the qbits on the table are measured, and whomever's bits add up to the highest number wins.
